# School-Choice

Code of for the simulation exercise of my economics final dissertation on school choice (link to spanish version:https://eprints.ucm.es/59311/). The Immediate Acceptance algorithm is used in Spain when allocating students to seats in publicly financed schools. However, the priority criteria are established by each autonomous region (Comunidad Aut√≥noma - CC.AA). In the region of Madrid a reformed was undertaken in the academic year 2012/2013, which mainly changed the definition and importance given to such criteria, and the simulation presented in this code tries to evaluate the impact of such reform in the final allocations: who benefits and who is worse-off after the reform is implemented.
